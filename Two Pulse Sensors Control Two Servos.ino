/* 
   Original Arduino Sketch to detect pulses from two PulseSensors 
   has been modified by Omar Ansari and Aaron Soloway to include 
   two servo motors that move 30Ëš each time a heartbeat is detected.

   This program was modified/created to explore Arduino 
   robotics' ability to facilitate interconnectedness between people meditating by 
   allowing participants to externalize their pulse using the servo motors. 
   The motor is attached to a drumstick which strikes a gong each time a 
   heart beat is detected. The ideal version of this program would include 
   a function that measures the distance between the two participants' pulses and upon 
   reaching a particular threshold creates a third output that signifies 
   that the participants' heartbeats have become more synchronous.

/*
   Every Sketch that uses the PulseSensor Playground must
   define USE_ARDUINO_INTERRUPTS before including PulseSensorPlayground.h.
   Here, #define USE_ARDUINO_INTERRUPTS false tells the library to
   not use interrupts to read data from the PulseSensor.

   If you want to use interrupts, simply change the line below
   to read:
     #define USE_ARDUINO_INTERRUPTS true

   Set US_PS_INTERRUPTS to false if either
   1) Your Arduino platform's interrupts aren't yet supported
   by PulseSensor Playground, or
   2) You don't wish to use interrupts because of the side effects.

   NOTE: if US_PS_INTERRUPTS is false, your Sketch must
   call pulse.sawNewSample() at least once every 2 milliseconds
   to accurately read the PulseSensor signal.
